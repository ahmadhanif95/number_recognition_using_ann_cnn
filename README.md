 Number Recognition Project using ANN and CNN Neural Networks

Project Description:
------------------------------

**Introduction:**

The Number Recognition Project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is an open-source project aimed at creating a robust and accurate system for recognizing and classifying handwritten digits. This project leverages the power of deep learning techniques to build models capable of accurately recognizing and classifying digits from 0 to 9.

**Project Goals:**

1. Develop and implement artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition.
2. Create a comprehensive dataset of handwritten digits for training and testing the models.
3. Train the models to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying digits.
4. Evaluate and fine-tune the models for optimal performance.
5. Build a user-friendly interface for users to input and test their own handwritten digits.

**Features:**

The Number Recognition Project offers the following features:

1. **ANN and CNN Models**: The project will provide implementations of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for digit recognition. Users can choose between these two models based on their requirements and dataset size.

2. **Training and Evaluation**: A well-documented training pipeline will be available for users to train the models on their own datasets and evaluate their performance.

3. **Accuracy and Performance**: The project aims to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits while keeping computational requirements in mind.

4. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow users to input their own handwritten digits and test the model's accuracy.

5. **Extensibility**: The project will be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily modify and adapt the models for various applications.

**Technologies Used:**

The project will primarily use the following technologies:

- Python
- deep learning models
